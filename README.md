# Holberton Airbnb Clone Project
This project is a clone of the Airbnb website, built as part of the curriculum at Holberton School. The goal of the project is to develop a full-stack web application that allows users to search for and book accommodations, as well as list their own accommodations for rent.

## The console
The project includes a console that allows you to create, update, and delete objects in the application's data models. The console uses a storage engine that provides an abstraction layer between the objects and how they are stored and persisted. This means that you don't need to worry about the underlying storage mechanism when interacting with the objects.

## Data Model
The project provides a set of data models for accommodations, users, bookings, and messages. You can extend these models or create your own as needed.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter provides a set of commands that allow you to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects, as well as display information about them. The console also provides an interactive mode that allows you to enter commands one at a time, as well as a non-interactive mode that allows you to run a set of commands from a script.
